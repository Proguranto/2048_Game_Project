## Description

A similar version to the 2048 board game, but made where you are able to adjust the board size from 2 x 2 up to 5 x 5. Increase or decrease the difficulty by decreasing or increasing the board size (2 x 2 is Impossible). This is a beginner project for me in order for me to develop my programming skills.
